How to compile and run the program (Linux)

Running the program requires SFML to be installed on the computer. Instructions for installation can be found at https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-linux.php.

In the hill-racing-1/src folder, run the terminal command ‘make’ to compile the program. To start the app, run the command ‘./hills-racing’.


How to play

In the main menu, you can choose a level or view high scores by clicking the appropriate button on screen. The three levels have increasing difficulty.

The game starts immediately after selecting a level. The car can be controlled with the following controls:
Up/W: Accelerate
Down/S: Decelerate
Left/A: Tilt up
Right/D: Tilt down
Restart: R
Main menu: Esc

You receive points based on the finishing time and the number of star-shaped tokens collected. The top three scores for each level are saved.

If the car gets stuck upside down or falls off screen, you lose the game. You can return to the main menu during the game or from the Game Over screen by pressing Esc on the keyboard. You can restart the current map by pressing R during gameplay or in the Game Over screen.
